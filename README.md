# DataStructuresAndAlgs

This is all of the individual classwork on implementing Data Structures and Algorithms. 
Included are some unit tests formed by other students and the TA's. If you look through
you may notice that a lot of these are simplified. While that may look as if the
implementation is limited, it is just to spec of the assignment. We are taught how to 
think critically when designing a solution.

Try some out if you'd like!
